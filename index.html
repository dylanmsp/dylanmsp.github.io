                         <p>The Total Protection Model&trade; Explained</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box_curves_text">
                         <p style="margin-top: 0em;">The legacy <em style="color: #6dc065;">break/fix</em> service model is reactive... much like refrigerators, IT issues are fixed for a premium charge only after something breaks. It's challenging to anticipate and budget. Break/fix still finds usefulness in hardware support, but always-online connectivity and cloud services mean current software desires a better approach.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">The modern <em style="color: #6dc065;">managed services</em> model adds a proactive approach, addressing more IT issues before they disrupt operations. Managed services are available through fixed-price subscription plans with no unexpected costs. The model provides service-level management to keep technology and devices maintained, updated, and safe from attacks or data loss, with as little customer interaction or end-user disruption as possible.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">MSP Tech Services created the Total Protection Model&trade; to provide both proactive and reactive support coverage for the key elements of a working IT infrastructure. There are two versions available:</p>
                         <div class="box_curves_model box_curves_all_text">

                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">In-house IT professionals benefit from the Total Protection Model&trade; from MSP Tech Services. The collaboration when we work together leads to increased staff creativity and productivity. We'll take care of many administrative overhead tasks so you can focus on the bigger picture. Combining our teams together increases the available skill set and improves simultaneous problem-solving.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">SMBs can experience significant improvements. Less reliance on a single employee for all responsibilities and projects means less vulnerability if the employee is sick or finds another position. A single employee needs to concentrate on a single issue and is often distracted by tedious administrative tasks. MSP Tech Services adds an entire IT team to a company’s assets. We work together with management and staff to find advantages and develop strategies to get the best from your current and brand-new resources.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">We do this by delivering a set of critical tools that work together for your business:</p>
                         <div class="box_curves_all_text">
                              <div class="model_blue" style="font-size: 1em; color: #f7f7f7; background-color: #305284; border-bottom: 0.2em solid #f7f7f7">
                                   <p>TOTAL PROTECTION MODEL&trade;</p>
                              </div>
                         </div>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">Our proactive, cloud-based <em style="color: #6dc065;">remote IT management software</em> (also known as RMM) provides a scalable way to secure, monitor, and manage client endpoints, networks, and computers. You get enterprise-grade monitoring and automation of IT systems at an affordable fixed monthly price. RMM software is lightweight and unobtrusive on servers and workstations.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">End-users benefit from increased uptime and uninterrupted workflow while patches and diagnostics run quietly in the background. IT staff find more time to be creative and can focus on other valuable projects, while we provide around-the-clock network management of common daily tasks. The management team can review detailed reports and inventories to help properly budget for IT and company expectations.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">Our advanced <em style="color: #6dc065;">cybersecurity suite</em> manages risks and defends against malware, data leakage, theft, software vulnerabilities, exploits, ransomware, malicious traffic, and more. We combine two critical services into a comprehensive software suite: a proactive module and a reactive module.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">Vulnerabilities are common! They are exploitable weaknesses in systems or services. Each 1,000 lines of written code contains up to 20 bugs of varying severity. Their criminal exploitation leads to economic or other losses by users and companies. Vulnerabilities are unavoidable and must be mitigated as quickly as possible, using all available resources. Countermeasures play a large role in the exploitability of a vulnerability.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">The size of a business is often less important to an attacker than the potential of a business. The data it owns, the <em style="color: #6dc065;">personally-identifiable information</em> (PII) it contains, the network opacity, and other factors can be far more desirable than targeting a high-profile company. Most attack groups focus on intelligence gathering. Employees create security issues just by using an open internet connection. 1 in 13 web requests out of every billion leads to malware.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">Normal users find cyber defense confusing to understand or difficult to achieve. Defense requires spending time and resources on advanced malware techniques, infection safeguards, intelligent traffic filters, third-party updates, and blocking malicious websites or social engineering scams. A secure multi-layered active protection package lessens the required time and resources.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">Our North American <em style="color: #6dc065;">network operations center</em> (NOC) and <em style="color: #6dc065;">help desk</em> is staffed by senior technicians available to you during all business hours. End-users get responsive help desk support for products from Microsoft, Apple, and many other third-party vendors. Servers and network devices are maintained by the NOC. Our technicians will even coordinate with many vendors so you don't need to wait on hold.</p>
                         <div class="box_curves_all_text">
                              <div class="model_green" style="font-size: 1em; color: #f7f7f7; background-color: #305284; border-bottom: 0.2em solid #f7f7f7">
                                   <p>TPM with SECURITY+&trade;</p>

                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">TPM with Security+&trade; provides a reliable encrypted backup service to the cloud. A heavy shift from on-site backups to <em style="color: #6dc065;">cloud-based backups</em> is now proven and accepted. Traditional on-site backup means someone has to remember to change tapes or swap media, bringing with it all the potential problems should data not be available to restore.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">There are a large number of online backup solutions in the market and the concept of cloud backups is both proven and accepted. Our hybrid cloud-based backup and recovery solution integrates with our remote IT management software to provide you with a cohesive single-faced solution at a lower cost than most online backup vendors.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">We use backup technology which searches for changes at disk block level. On average, only 0.1 - 0.5% of the protected data set there has any changes, making it highly effective at maximizing bandwidth and storage capacity. We also utilize technology that simultaneously backs data up locally as well as to the cloud, providing near-instant access to important files.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text"><em style="color: #6dc065;">Risk intelligence</em> enables you to quickly and easily perform ongoing risk assessments within your IT environment. You can calculate the real-time risk of a data breach and assign it a monetary value. This is achieved through intelligent deep scans on target devices, covering possible informational breaches and improve your PCI DSS, HIPAA, or FINRA compliance.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">You'll be able to gain visibility of any sensitive data on any device: easily identify unprotected data and its location - including highly-sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as credit card numbers, dates of birth, government-issued identification, or financial account numbers - to better understand how an attacker would compromise it, and how much a data breach would cost.</p>
                         <p class="box_curves_all_text">Minimise the risk of cost-prohibitive and crippling data breaches, that are detrimental not only to your company, but also its reputation.</p>
