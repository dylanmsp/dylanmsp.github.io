                         <p>The Total Protection Model&trade; Explained</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box_curves_text">
                         <p style="margin-top: 0;">The legacy <em style="color: #6dc065;">break/fix</em> service model is reactive... much like refrigerators, IT issues are fixed for a premium charge only after something breaks. It's challenging to anticipate and budget. Break/fix still finds usefulness in hardware support, but always-online connectivity and cloud services mean current software desires a better approach.</p>
                         <p>The modern <em style="color: #6dc065;">managed services</em> model adds a proactive approach, addressing more IT issues before they disrupt operations. Managed services are available through fixed-price subscription plans with no unexpected costs. The model provides service-level management to keep technology and devices maintained, updated, and safe from attacks or data loss, with as little customer interaction or end-user disruption as possible.</p>
                         <p>MSP Tech Services created the Total Protection Model&trade; to provide both proactive and reactive support coverage for the key elements of a working IT infrastructure. There are two versions available.</p>

                         <p>In-house IT professionals benefit from the Total Protection Model&trade; from MSP Tech Services. The collaboration when we work together leads to increased staff creativity and productivity. We'll take care of many administrative overhead tasks so you can focus on the bigger picture. Combining our teams together increases the available skill set and improves simultaneous problem-solving.</p>
                         <p>SMBs often see significant gains. There is less reliance on a single team member for all responsibilities and projects. Companies are less vulnerable when the team member is sick or finds another position. A single team member needs to concentrate on a single issue and is often distracted by tedious administrative tasks. MSP Tech Services adds an entire IT team to a company’s assets. We work together with management and staff to find advantages and develop strategies to get the most out of current and brand-new resources.</p>
                         <p>We do this by delivering a set of critical tools that work together for your business:</p>
                         <p>Our proactive, cloud-based <em style="color: #6dc065;">remote IT management software</em> (also known as RMM) provides a scalable way to secure, monitor, and manage client endpoints, networks, and computers. You get enterprise-grade monitoring and automation of IT systems at an affordable fixed monthly price. RMM software is lightweight and unobtrusive on servers and workstations.</p>
                         <p>End-users benefit from increased uptime and uninterrupted workflow while patches and diagnostics run quietly in the background. IT staff find more time to be creative and can focus on other valuable projects, while we provide around-the-clock network management of common daily tasks. The management team can review detailed reports and inventories to help properly budget for IT and company expectations.</p>
                         <p>Our advanced <em style="color: #6dc065;">cybersecurity suite</em> manages risks and defends against malware, data leakage, theft, software vulnerabilities, exploits, ransomware, malicious traffic, and more. We combine two critical services into a comprehensive software suite: a proactive module and a reactive module.</p>
                         <p>Vulnerabilities are common. Vulnerabilities are exploitable weaknesses in systems or services. Programmers aim for perfect code, but each 1,000 lines of code contains up to 20 bugs of varying severity. The exploitation of these bugs by criminals lead to economic or other losses by users and companies. Vulnerabilities are unavoidable and must be mitigated as quickly as possible, using all available resources. Countermeasures play a large role in the exploitability of a vulnerability.</p>
                         <p>The size of a business is often less important to an attacker than the potential of a business. The data it owns, the <em style="color: #6dc065;">personally-identifiable information</em> (PII)</p> it contains, the opacity of the network for sneaking around, and other factors can be far more desirable than targeting a high-profile company. Most attack groups focus on intelligence gathering. Company employees often unwittingly cause security issues using an open internet connection. 1 in 13 web requests out of every billion leads to malware.
                         <p>The average user find cyber defense confusing to understand or difficult to achieve. Defense requires time and resources spent on things like keeping up with advanced malware techniques, safeguarding against infections, building intelligent internet traffic filters, updating third-party applications, and blocking malicious websites or social engineering scams. Teh time and resources to successfully navigate and manage the defense of a business against criminals can be better used elsewhere by installing a secure multi-layered protection package.</p>
                         <p>Our North American <em style="color: #6dc065;">network operations center</em> (NOC) and <em style="color: #6dc065;">help desk</em> are staffed by senior technicians available to your company during all business hours. End-users get responsive help desk support for products from Microsoft, Apple, and many other third-parties. Support is wide-ranging and includes events like driver installation, application support, virus removal, Group Policy implementation, mobile device troubleshooting, or Office 365 assistance. Servers and network devices are managed by the NOC, including things like incident monitoring, network connectivity diagnosis, virus cleanup, security patching, software installs, user account management, access point configuration, or firmware updates. Our technicians will even coordinate with many vendors so you don't need to wait on hold.</p>
                         <p>Along with peace of mind, MSP Tech Services provides your business with the IT support you need when you need it, and our automated IT support technologies reduce your maintenance costs. A fixed-cost monthly payment structure allows you to avoid surprise invoices and helps you accurately plan a budget.</p>
