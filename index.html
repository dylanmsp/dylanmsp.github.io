                         <p>The Total Protection Model<sup>&trade;</sup> Explained</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box_curves_text">
                         <p style="margin-top: 0;">The legacy <em>break/fix</em> service model is reactive... much like refrigerators, IT issues are fixed for a premium charge only after something breaks. It's challenging to anticipate and budget. Break/fix still finds usefulness in hardware support, but always-online connectivity and cloud services mean current software desires a better approach.</p>
                         <p>The modern <em>managed services</em> model adds a proactive approach, addressing more IT issues before they disrupt operations. Managed services are available through fixed-price subscription plans with no unexpected costs. The model provides service-level management to keep technology and devices maintained, updated, and safe from attacks or data loss, with as little customer interaction or end-user disruption as possible.</p>
                         <p>MSP Tech Services created the Total Protection Model<sup>&trade;</sup> to provide both proactive and reactive support coverage for the key elements of a working IT infrastructure. There are two versions available.</p>

                              <div class="model_blue">

                         <p>A managed service model, like the Total Protection Model<sup>&trade;</sup> from MSP Tech Services, does not aim to negate the benefits of having IT professionals on staff. The collaboration when a managed service provider and in-house professionals work together often leads to significant increases in productivity and usefulness for the employees, who benefit from the greatly-reduced administrative overhead tasks now covered by MSP Tech Services. Multiple people can simultaneously work on multiple issues, and benefit from the increased skill set of a team effort.</p>
                         <p>There are certainly things to consider when staffing full-time IT professionals. There are significant salary and overhead costs, and often a strong reliance on a single person, which can leave a company vulnerable if someone quits, becomes ill, or takes a vacation. A single employee can only handle a single issue at a time and is often distracted by tedious administrative tasks.</p>
                         <p>MSP Tech Services adds an entire IT team to a companyâ€™s assets, working together with management and IT staff to find advantages and develop strategies to get the most out of currently available and brand-new resources.</p>
                         <p>MSP Tech Services delivers proactive cloud-based remote IT management software (also known as remote monitoring and management, or RMM) to provide a scalable set of tools for securing, monitoring, and managing client endpoints, networks, and computers. The toolset allows enterprise-level monitoring and automation of IT systems at an affordable fixed monthly price. RMM software is lightweight and unobtrusive on servers and workstations.</p>
                         <p>End-users benefit from increased uptime and uninterrupted workflow while the required updates and diagnostics run silently in the background. IT team members find more time to be creative and can focus on other valuable projects while MSP Tech Services provides around-the-clock network management of common daily administrative tasks. Executives and the management team can review detailed reports and inventories to more effectively set an IT budget and expectations.</p>
